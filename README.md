# RTLDS-Real-Time-Lane-Detection

## Introduction
Computer Vision is made up of several methodologies to analyze and derive information from images/videos. One such is the mathematical approach we are using here with OpenCV to identify lane lines - 'Hough Transform'. The technique used here can be applied to similar problems such as ‘vein detection’, or alternatively expanded to integrate embedded systems. The aim of this project is to create a system that can, in real time, identify and mark lane lines by overlaying them on a live feed. 

## Features
1. Upload a still image for lane detection
2. Upload a video for lane detection
3. Access camera for live, real time lane detection
4. Clear uploaded media and live feed
